    <h2>Brazilian Cheese Bread (Pao de Queijo)</h2>
    <p>
      Pao de queijo are yummy gluten-free, wheat-free breads that are good for
      those with celiac disease or gluten intolerance. Serve them plain or with
      marinara sauce. For more variety, try adding an herb seasonings, such as
      Italian seasoning, or try substituting other cheeses for the Parmesan.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <ul class="lists">
        <li>½ cup olive oil or butter</li>
        <li>⅓ cup water</li>
        <li>⅓ cup milk or soy milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups tapioca flour</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>

      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <div class="container">
      <ol class="lists">
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>
          Combine olive oil, water, milk, and salt in a large saucepan and place
          over high heat. Bring to a boil and immediately remove from the heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir in tapioca flour and garlic, stirring until smooth. Set aside to
          rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Stir cheese and eggs into tapioca mixture until combined; the dough
          will be chunky, like cottage cheese.
        </li>
        <li>
          Drop dough by 1/4 cup-size balls onto an ungreased baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake in the preheated oven until the tops are lightly browned, 15 to
          20 minutes.
        </li>
      </ol>
